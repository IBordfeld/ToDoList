a. How program runs:
     1. the program will display all the lists that you have and have additional choices to add a new list, remove a list, or save and exit. 
     Here you will be able enter a number that correspondes with a list or a number that correspondes with an additional option at the bottom of 
     the menu. 
     
     2. If you select "Add a new list" or "Remove a new list", then you will be asked for a name to add or remove from your overall lists. If you 
     select "Save and Exit", then the program will save your lists and exit the program without error.

     3. If you selected a list from the menu, then it will take you into the appropriate list. 
     For example, when you go into a list you could see:
     Store:
          - Milk
          - Eggs
          - Butter
          1. Add to list
          2. Remove from list
          3. Go back to all my lists

     To interact witht he list, you will need to select 1 or 2 and be prompted to enter the name of the item you want to add/remove. Case sensitivity 
     does matter! If you want to return to all of your lists, then select 3.
