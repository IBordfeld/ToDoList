a.
Our project is a to-do list program. It first lists an overall category that the list can be generalized as. 
Then when you select that list it will list off what was on the list. First, the program will display all the 
lists that you have and have additional choices to add a new list, remove a list, or save and exit. Here you 
will be able to select a number that you would like to go into and it will take you to the list etc. Next, it
will display the context of the list and ask if you want to add to the list or remove something from the list.
